    <p>I am not exactly the average person, to say the least. I am not neurotypical, nor do I conform to most of 
    society. Some people may say this is a bad thing. But what is so great about being average? And why should 
    I be ashamed of being different?</p>
    <p>I am autistic. This means that I have intense interests, have difficulty understanding social cues and social norms, 
    stim a lot, and am sensitive to noise and light. If I do figure out social norms? I will just reject them.</p>
    <p>I am a very quiet person. I only speak when I think it's important to speak or if one of my special 
    interests is brought up. Some people think I should be more talkative, but it's just the way I am.</p>
    <p>I do not have conventional interests either. If you looked at my other pages, you know that I'm 
    interested in physics, especially the parts that blow people's minds. I also like philosophy. I like 
    speculating about those questions that are impossible to definitively answer. One side effect is that 
    I have a tendency to get lost in my head. But hey, at least I can easily entertain myself when I'm 
    alone.</p>

    <p class="imagecaption">And did I tell you I like bad puns? Along with being a complete geek?</p>
    <p>I reject the mainstream. First off, I hate the music that is popular right now. I instead like classic 
    rock, especially rock from the 80s. I especially like goth rock, which, contrary to popular belief, is not 
    related to metal, nor associated with Satanists. It is a type of post-punk music with a dark sound and themes.

    <p class="imagecaption">Ever heard of this guy? Didn't think so.</p>
    <p>Second of all, I do not want the same kind of life that people call "a good life". No one should try to fit their life in 
    a box because what people want out of life varies. While I do want a college education, I want to have it not 
    for the money or prestige but rather so that I can work at a job that I love. And I just like educating myself.</p>
