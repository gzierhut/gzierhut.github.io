 <h3>What is Physics?</h3>     
   <p>Physics is the study of matter and energy. It is the study of the fundamentals of how the universe works.
   There are multiple branches of physics.</p>
   <h3>What are the branches of physics?</h3>
   <h4>Classical Mechanics</h4>

   <p>Classical mechanics is the study of motion in the everyday world. 
   It's equations are accurate for describing the ordinary, but if they are applied to anything outside ordinary experience, they fall apart.
    Classical mechanics cannot describe the very large, the very small, or anything going at a speed close to the speed of light. 
    It is for these reasons that classical mechanics was succeeded by other fields.</p>
    <h4>Relativity</h4>

    <p>Relativity is the study of spacetime. It reconciles two seemingly contradictory ideas: 
    that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in all inertial frames of reference
    and that the speed of light is the same for all observers.</p>
    <p>This leads to many counterintuitive concepts. Due to relativity, 
    time goes slower the faster the observer's speed is, objects shorten when an observer is moving relative to the object, and energy and mass are equivalent.</p>
    <p>Another consequence of relativity is that an object's mass distorts spacetime, which is what gives rise to gravity. 
    Gravity causes time to slow down and makes light bend.</p>

    <h4>Quantum Mechanics</h4>

    <p>Quantum mechanics is the physics of very small particles. Like relativity, the concepts involved in
    quantum mechanics are also counterintuitive. For example, particles can be in a superposition of many different
    possible states, and then collapse into one state when observed. This is demonstrated in the Schrodinger's
    cat thought experiment (good thing it is just a thought experiment. Poor cat), in which a cat in a sealed box is
    simultaneously alive and dead until someone opens the box. There are many interpretations of this thought
    experiment, and many philosophical implications.</p>
    <p>Another concept is that particles are simultaneously waves. Matter and light have both particle-like and
    wavelike behavior. Also, energy comes in discrete units called quanta. A photon is a package of
    electromagnetic energy.</p>
    <p>Another concept is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Due to the uncertainty principle, if the
     position of a particle is being observed, its momentum is uncertain, and vice versa. The values of the 
     property not being observed can only be assigned a probability.</p>
