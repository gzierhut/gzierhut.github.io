  <h1>Cats</h1>

  <p>Some people seem to think that cats are less intelligent than dogs. Maybe it's because they associate 
  an animal's intelligence with their willingness to obey commands. But really, cats are just more independent. 
  My cat has shown me many times how smart he is through manipulating me into giving him attention. He has 
  used a slipper as a door knocker, and has tried to press the button on my computer even though he has been trained not to.</p>
  <p>Cats have a very good memory. They can remember events for a very long time. They also can learn their owner's 
  routines and get concerned if they are broken. This makes them creatures of habit.</p>
  <p>Contrary to popular belief, cats are not untrainable. Food is a motivator for a cat to learn tricks. However, 
  do not expect cats to comply all the time. Sometimes they have a different objective in mind than their humans.</p>
  <h1>Octopuses</h1>

  <p>Octopuses are probably the closest thing to aliens we know. They are very intelligent creatures. Their nervous 
  system is not organized in the same way ours is. Their brain is essentially distributed throughout their body. 
  This allows each tentacle to act independently.</p>
